Telemarketing Prediction Service
This repository contains a Telemarketing Prediction Service, built as part of my Machine Learning practice project. The aim of the project is to predict the success of telemarketing calls based on historical data and various features. The model uses different machine learning techniques to forecast whether a telemarketing call will result in a successful conversion.

Overview
The project utilizes datasets from a telemarketing service, where the goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit after being contacted. The data includes demographic information, campaign data, and historical call outcomes. Various machine learning models were explored, evaluated, and deployed to predict the likelihood of a successful subscription.

Kaggle Achievement üèÖ
I am proud to share that my model achieved a Kaggle rank of 151 out of 1250 competitors, with a score of 0.76308. This accomplishment showcases the effectiveness of the predictive model and my skill in leveraging machine learning algorithms for real-world problem-solving.

Kaggle Rank: 151/1250
Kaggle Score: 0.76308
This performance is a testament to the hard work, experimentation, and refinement of the models throughout the course of this project.

Key Features
